# Song Name Generator
The "Song Name Generator" is a React-based web application that allows users to generate creative song or production names based on a description input. The application leverages the OpenAI API to provide contextually relevant and creative name suggestions. Users can enter a description, and the app responds with a unique name inspired by the provided context.
